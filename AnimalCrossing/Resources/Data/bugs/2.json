If I must, then allow me to note that the female yellow butterfly can lay up to 600 eggs at a time! Bleech! And their creepy crawly caterpillars just love to chomp on clover plants. A recipe for disaster, I say. Just imagine reaching for a four-leaf clover, only to touch a larva instead! Yuck! The worst of luck!",
