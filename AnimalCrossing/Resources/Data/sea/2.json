  "museum-phrase": "Sea grapes are a marine algae that look much like their landlocked namesake. That is, they are green pearl-like orbs that cluster tightly along underwater vines.

It makes one wonder whether sea grape juice might have some appeal? 'Twould leave the drinker with sour grapes, I suppose."
