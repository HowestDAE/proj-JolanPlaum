And sea grapes, like regular grapes, are a popular snack food too... albeit of the saltier variety. Fans of the briny delicacy enjoy the way the shiny pearls POP when chewed. It makes one wonder whether sea grape juice might have some appeal? 'Twould leave the drinker with sour grapes, I suppose."

Brace yourself I say… when threatened sea cucumbers jettison their innards out of their backsides! Hoo! Gross but true! The sticky, stringy stuff ensnares predators, allowing the cuke to make its escape and grow its insides back. One might say…the sea cucumber is a GUTSY creature, indeed. Hoo hoo, hee hee! Do forgive me!"
