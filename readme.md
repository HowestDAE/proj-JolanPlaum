Topic: Animal Crossing: New Horizons critterpedia

Why? Because it can be used by users who play the game to have
 a nice overview of which critters they can catch and when. That
 way they can check for example which critters they still need to
 catch to complete their collection, and when they'll be available.

You can switch between online/offline repositories by clicking a button
